* Merge pull request `#383 <https://github.com/plusone-robotics/realsense/issues/383>`_ from mikolajz/my-development
  Fix coordinate system transforms so that the pointcloud aligns with camera view
* Fixing the length of an array argument in rotationMatrixToQuaternion
* Add mesh and urdf for D435
* Also when align_depth is no, publish proper data on extrinsic topics.
  AFAIK there is no convention of what to publish on extrinsic topics, so you
  may choose to keep it as is, but I would say the current behavior can be
  surprising in a negative way.
* Fix the rotation quaternion in coordinate transforms.
  When going from one optical frame to another, the actual rotation we are
  performing is quaternion_optical.inverse() * Q * quaternion_optical, so we
  need to for the final rotation to be as specific in the extrinsics.
  The pointcloud is now properly aligned.
* Publish coordinate system transforms also when align depth is on.
  That fact that aligned_depth_to\_* is in color coordinates is already
  experessed by these cameras camera_info reporting the color frame. However,
  for the "depth", "infra1" etc. camera to be properly reported and for the
  pointcloud to have a change to align, we need to report the transformations.
* In coordinate system transforms, fix which extrincits we use and use matrix properly.
  Two bugs which cancel out each other for rotation, but not translation:
  - it seems that ROS and Realsense use different conventions of coordinate
  system transformations. In ROS, it is defined as a transformation of child
  fame coordinates to parent frame coordinates (see
  http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Overview/Transformations), while in RealSense
  it seems to be transformation of "from" frame coordinates to "to" frame
  coordinates. Thus, the order needs to be reversed.
  - the matrix in RealSense extrinsics is stored in column-major format, while
  Eigen::Matrix3f expects row-major, causing the matrix to be transposed.
  To see that this is a problem, one can open rviz and add the pointcloud and the
  color/image_raw camera. From the camera viewpoint, the images should align, but
  don't. This patch doesn't yet solve the whole problem, but makes it smaller.
* Fixes librealsense CMake vars.
* fix the aligned depth frame unit conversion issue
* Merge pull request `#364 <https://github.com/plusone-robotics/realsense/issues/364>`_ from lorenwel/fix/aligned_depth_cam_info
  aligned_depth_to\_... assign stream cam info instead of depth
* Assign stream cam info instead of depth
